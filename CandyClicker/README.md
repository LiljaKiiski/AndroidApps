# Notes
1. This was one of my first networked applications, it is buggy
2. If a player quits during the game, game may freeze, server might stop working, etc.
3. The server only handles one game at a time
4. If you want to see a better networked game (not for Android though), you can visit [this](https://github.com/LiljaKiiski/Arcade/tree/master/Gomoku)
